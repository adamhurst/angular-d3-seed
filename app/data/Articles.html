They prefer to use traditional healers, which may help the disease spread faster. Some believe that victims have been cursed by a "witch gun," and that only a witch doctor can remove the curse. Official healthcare workers have been denied access to the sick or refused blood samples. In one case, health workers were stoned by villagers who were trying to remove ebola patients from a healthcare center. "Given a health-care system lacking decent equipment, qualified staff and affordable drugs (rather than the more popular counterfeit ones), a lack of faith in Western medicine is understandable. The ministry of health has put out flyers with answers to questions such as “Is it true Ebola is a curse?” and “Can a mix of ginger, honey, garlic, onion and vinegar cure ebola?” At the same time, the authorities have used mobile-phone networks to warn people by text to avoid eating the meat of bats, one of the disease’s prime carriers. A band based in neighbouring Liberia, which also has the scourge, has released a catchy new song with lyrics such as “Ebola, ebola in town/Don’t touch your friend/No eating something/It’s dangerous”."</p>

Many cases are unreported because sick people may choose to self-treat or use traditional medicine rather than go to a hospital. In addition, diagnostic tests are expensive and diagnosis may stigmatize a patient.</p>

Apart from the Japanese drug, the west African country had also applied for another anti-Ebola drug alongside two other vaccines which have been positively identified by the local Treatment Research Group (TRG) in Nigeria. 'The TRG has been working hard to identify experimental drugs like Zmapp, and also make recommendations to government on further research on these drugs as well as vaccines for EVD treatment and prevention,' Chukwu said. The Nigerian minister said the drug was considered as it has strong anti-viral property against Ebola virus in-vitro and in-vivo. 'These and the fact that it is considered safe, having passed through phases one and two clinical trails makes it good candidate drug for use in emergency situation as the EVD,' he added."</p>

The already impoverished west African state was on the slow road to recovery after 14 years of ruinous civil war ended in 2003, following the deaths of 250,000 people. But Information Minister Lewis Brown recently warned that the epidemic, which has left more than 1,800 dead so far this year, risks plunging Liberians back into conflict. Many observers of the country's latest devastating crisis, while stopping short of talk of war, worry about the heightened risk of unrest in a country stalked by death."</p>
<p>"Several police stations in Monrovia have closed after officers died of Ebola fever, and a military camp on the outskirts of Monrovia has reported around 30 sick soldiers, according to a diplomat."</p>
<p>"The health system – embryonic at best before the crisis, with some 50 doctors and 1,000 nurses for 4.3 million people – has been hit hard, losing 89 health workers out of 184 infected, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)."</p>

They also say there are no other suspected cases of Ebola in the state. Experts say the man did not exhibit symptoms of the disease on the plane, which is good news. Ebola does not spread until an individual is sick with the virus. It’s not spread through the air, it’s spread through direct contact with a person who is infected with it. This is the first case of Ebola where someone traveled to the United States and became sick after arriving in this country. 'There is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here,' CDC Director Tom Frieden says."</p>

The authorities also said that an early opportunity to put the patient in isolation, limiting the risk of contagion, may have been missed because of a failure to pass along critical information about his travel history. The patient was identified by Liberian health officials and The Associated Press as Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national. Mr. Duncan came to the United States on Sept. 20 aboard a commercial airliner and officials said that he had shown no symptoms of the disease while on the flight and that he had posed no threat to other passengers. Mr. Duncan worked at a shipping company in Monrovia, Liberia, but had just quit his job, giving his resignation in early September, his boss said. He had gotten a visa to the United States and had decided to go, his neighbors said. He lived alone, but has family in the United States, they said. Mr. Duncan may have become infected after his landlord’s daughter fell gravely ill."</p>
<p>"Even as public officials sought to reassure the public that the situation was under control, there were questions about how the patient was treated when he first went to a hospital on Sept. 26. Dr. Mark Lester, executive vice president of the Texas Health Resources System, said the hospital staff had been instructed to ask patients about their travel history, following the advice of federal authorities. That checklist, he said, was utilized by a nurse and the patient volunteered that he had just come from Liberia. 'Regretfully that information was not fully communicated' to the full medical team, Dr. Lester said. As a result, that information was not used in the clinical diagnosis and Mr. Duncan was sent home, with the diagnostic team believing he simply had a low-grade fever from a viral infection. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance two days later, his condition having significantly deteriorated. He remains in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas in serious condition. In the time between Mr. Duncan’s trips to the hospital, health officials said he came into contact with more people while he was symptomatic and infectious."</p>

'Following the discovery on October 5 that an UNMIL medical staff member was symptomatic for Ebola, the mission conducted robust contact tracing to ensure all people that came into contact with the staff member while they were symptomatic are assessed and isolated as necessary,' it said in a statement."</p>
<p>"The announcement of the infection came a week after UNMIL said a Liberian employee had died of probable Ebola. The mission said it would extend a review of its actions launched after the first case to investigating the circumstances of the latest infection."</p>

Authorities want the forty-three persons quarantined because they interacted with a suspected Ebola patient who died later. According to the Liberia News Agency correspondent in the county, this was disclosed by the county Assistant Superintendent for Development, Tenneh Simpson Kpedebah, Wednesday during the County Ebola Task Force coordination meeting held in Sinje. She expressed fear that the refusal of the people to be quarantined in accordance with Ministry of Health regulations could lead to the spread of the Ebola virus in the county."</p>
<p>"Kpedebah said the citizens are refusing to be quarantined on grounds that they need supplies such as mattresses, clothes and cooking utensils. Madam Kpedebah explained that the citizens said they will not honor the quarantine regulations if the county Ebola Task Force fails to supply them with the needed items. She noted that presently, Grand Cape Mount County does not have any withholding Center; so they are quarantining people in their respective homes. She said the lack of withholding centers is one of the major challenges facing the county task force in the fight against the spread of the Ebola disease."</p>

'I have never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure.' More than 4,000 people have died from the Ebola virus, all but a handful of them in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to W.H.O. estimates issued last week. Dr. Chan declined to expand on those figures because they were still rising 'exponentially'."</p>

WHO assistant director-general Dr Bruce Aylward gave the grim figures during a news conference in Geneva. Previously, WHO had estimated the death rate at around 50 percent. Aylward said the 70 percent death rate was 'a high mortality disease' in any circumstance and that the UN health agency was still focused on trying to get sick people isolated and provide treatment as early as possible. He told reporters that if the world's response to the Ebola crisis isn't stepped up within 60 days, 'a lot more people will die' and there will be a huge need to deal with the spiraling numbers of cases. For the last four weeks, there's been about 1,000 new cases per week — including suspected, confirmed and probable cases, he said, adding that the UN health agency is aiming to get 70 percent of cases isolated within two months to reverse the outbreak.

<p>"Data for epidemiological week 41 are incomplete, with missing data for 12 October from Liberia. This reflects the challenging nature of data gathering in countries with widespread and intense EVD transmission. These challenges remain particularly acute in Liberia, where there continues to be a mismatch between the relatively low numbers of new cases reported through official clinical surveillance systems on one hand, and reports from laboratory staff and first responders of large numbers of new cases on the other"</p>
<p>"It is clear, however, that the situation in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is deteriorating, with widespread and persistent transmission of EVD. An increase in new cases in Guinea is being driven by a spike in confirmed and suspected cases in the capital, Conakry, and the nearby district of Coyah."</p>
<p>Guinea: "There is evidence of an increase in the intensity of transmission in Guinea. Compared with the previous week, a very slight drop in the number of new confirmed cases reported from the capital Conakry (figure 1) has been more than offset by a sharp rise in the number of new cases in the neighbouring district of Coyah, with 25 cases reported between 6 and 12 October ... In the east of the country, on the border with Co^te d’Ivoire, the districts of Beyla and Lola both reported new cases (figure 4), emphasizing the need for active surveillance at local border crossings. To the North, the district of Boke, on the border with Guinea-Bissau has reported active transmission for the first time in more than 21 days. The central district of Mamou has reported a confirmed case for the first time."</p>
<p>Liberia: "Data acquisition continues to be a challenge in Liberia. Evidence obtained from responders and laboratory staff in the country suggests that the situation in Liberia is getting worse, and that transmission remains intense in the capital, Monrovia ... Outside Monrovia, most newly reported cases have come from the districts of Bong (75 cases) and Margibi (28 cases)."</p>
<p>Sierra Leone: "EVD transmission is rampant in Sierra Leone, with 425 new confirmed cases reported between 6 and 12 October (figure 3). The areas hardest hit are the capital, Freetown, with 172 new cases, along with the neighbouring western districts of Bombali (94 cases) and Port Loko (67 cases)."</p>
<p>Health-Care Workers: As of 12th of October, 427 cases, 236 deaths.</p>

They include a passenger on an Air France jet that was isolated at Madrid's airport Thursday and a person who traveled in the same ambulance used to hospitalize infected Spanish nursing assistant Teresa Romero on Oct. 6. The other two were a Red Cross health worker who recently worked with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone and a missionary who came down with a fever after returning from Liberia."</p>

Twice the maximum incubation period of 21 days, or 42 days, has passed since a Guinean man who traveled to Dakar was confirmed as having Ebola, it said in a statement praising Senegalese authorities for their "diligence". The man has recovered and his 74 known contacts have not caught the disease. "While the outbreak is now officially over, Senegal's geographical position makes the country vulnerable to additional imported cases of Ebola virus disease. It continues to remain vigilant for any suspected cases by strict compliance with WHO guidelines," the U.N. agency said."</p>
